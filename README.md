# funboardgame
This is a fun board game made using java. The game hasn't reached its full functionality yet but it's still playable. 

#functionality
The game is basically 3x3 grid. each player has 3 pieces at the opposite end of the board. you can move pieces based on the board direction and the first person to match the 3 pieces wins

# pull req
the game isn't fully functional so I would be accepting any changes to the game.
